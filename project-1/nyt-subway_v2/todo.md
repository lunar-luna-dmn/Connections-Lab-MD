Questions and To-dos:
1. [for resident] fix the margin of the about section (right now it doens't have any margin at the end of the webpage even though I specified margin)
2. make uniform width for each section (to try overflow: visible)
3. [for resident] right now the API is set to sort by default (other options are by the newest or oldest), but it seems like it only shows the last month's content (e.g. in year 2023, the top articles are all from December and November)
4. add keywords function 
5. add year selector
6. add rat component (p5?) : rat running across the page, or make the cursor a bagel and have a rat chase it
7. add mosaic art of subway motifs and make them portals
