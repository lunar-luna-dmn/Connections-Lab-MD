Questions and To-dos:
1. [for resident] fix the margin of the about section (right now it doens't have any margin at the end of the webpage even though I specified margin)
2. [for resident] make uniform width for each section (e.g. if you change article header to fewer words like "TOP 10 ARTICLES", the article container (including poster and headline box) will be shrunk in width too)
3. [for resident] right now the API is set to sort by default (other options are by the newest or oldest), but it seems like it only shows the last month's content (e.g. in each year, the top articles are all from the last two months (for 2024 it's this month, for 2023 and prior years it's December and November)
4. add keywords function 
5. add year selector
6. add rat component (p5?) : rat running across the page, or make the cursor a bagel and have a rat chase it
7. add mosaic art of subway motifs and make them portals
