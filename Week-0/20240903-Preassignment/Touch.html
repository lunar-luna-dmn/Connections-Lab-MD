        <p1> The interactive installation is composed of an animated visual and a soft sculpture that the audience is invited to touch, press, stretch, or caress. Projected onto the wall is a realistic 3D model of my head in point cloud. By interacting with the soft sculpture, the participants can manipulate my head, slicing it into different faces, breaking it into a swirl of fragments, or suturing it back together.Â
