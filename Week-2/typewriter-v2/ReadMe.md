2-Sentence Horror Story
Typewriter animation

Question: I'd like to make it so that when you click "get help" all the existing text will be deleted (ideally in typewritter style), and then automatically a new line ("Never Mind. You are fine.") will start typing.
    1) How to create typewriter-style deleting animation in CSS? I tried to create a delete animation in CSS (commented out towards the end), but not sure how to add to the previous code. Also:
    2) How to use Javascript to activate a CSS animation?
    3) After deleting, how to start typing again in the same position as the original first line?
